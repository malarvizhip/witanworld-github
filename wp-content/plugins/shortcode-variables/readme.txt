Create your own shortcodes and assign text, html, etc to them. Use these across your site and only change in one place.

== Description ==

Do you want to use the same snippet throughout your site but only have to change the value in one location? If so, this plugin maybe just what you need.

You can create your own Shortcodes and assign text, HTML, JavaScript, etc to it. You will then be given a shortcode such as:

[shortcode-variables slug="your-slug-name"]

OR, even shorter syntax:

[s-var slug="your-slug-name"]

You can embed this shortcode throughout your site and it will render the same content. Simply update the Shortcode Variable in Tools > Shortcode Variables and it will change throughout the site!

** Specify Parameters **

Specify your own parameters:

You can now specify your own parameters when inserting a shortcode. For example, say you have a shortcode that renders a HTML table, you can now add parameters to the shortcode and specify where they appear in the shortcode e.g.

[s-var slug="render-table" border="0" background="#FFFFFF" width="50%" site-title="YeKen"] to place each parameter within a shortcode use the following syntax %%background%%, %%width%%, etc. See below:

<table border="%%border%%" style="background:%%background%%" width="%%width%%">
	<tr>
		<td>Welcome to our site, %%site-title%%.</td>
	</tr>
</table>

Comes with the following premade shortcodes:

- sc-todays-date -	Displays today's date. Default is UK format (DD/MM/YYYY). Format can be changed by adding the parameter format="m/d/Y" onto the shortcode. Format syntax is based upon PHP date: http://php.net/manual/en/function.date.php

= 1.7.2 =

- When creating a new shortcode, "Disabled" is set by default to "No".
- Additional upgrade check added. This compares the previously stored version number against the new version number. If there is a difference, it will run the DB table check again.

= 1.7.1 =

- BUG FIX: Tweak made to "on activate" so the code required to change the relevant database tables is called correctly.

= 1.7 =

- Disable a variable. You can now disable a variable via the admin panel - if a shortcode is disabled nothing will be rendered in it's place (will remove the shortcode though).
